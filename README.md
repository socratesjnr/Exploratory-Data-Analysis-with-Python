Exploratory Data Analysis on Hospital "No-show" appointments

In this project I take a deep dive into the Hospital No-show dataset that highlights how many times people scheduled for a doctors appointment have missed such appointments. I want to figure out 3 things so as to be able to make data-driven decisions, and the 3 questions I aim to answer are as follows

What percentage of patients that have appointments miss their appointments
Of the percentage that misses appointments, what is the gender ratio in percentages
Which ailment causes people to miss their appointment the most
